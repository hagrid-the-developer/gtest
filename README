Google test library with autotools build system. (the original has cmake).

build and install:
------------------
autoreconf -if
mkdir build && cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install

Update:
-------

Original sources are at:
https://github.com/google/googletest

Just replace sources in src/ by sources in googletest/src/. Do the same with
include directory.  Check, all the headers are noted in the propper
include/*/Makefile.am and .cc in src/Makefile.am. If there was a new one, just
add it.


Possible problem while using:
-----------------------------
$ pkg-config --libs libgtest_main
Package libgtest_main was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libgtest_main.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'libgtest_maind' found

Sollution:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

(put it to your .bashrc)
